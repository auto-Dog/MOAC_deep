# Code for article: Misaligned Over-The-Air Computation of Multi-Sensor Data with Wiener-Denoiser Network

Use jupyter notebook and run `src/main.ipynb`. Follow the notebook for dataset synthesis, training and evaluating.

It is recommend to run it on kaggle, and use _Gas sensor array temperature modulation_ dataset as input. Otherwise, you have to download the csv data and modify paths in `src/gen_dataset.py`.

Our wiener estimator is also implemented into Over-the-air Federate Learning, for the fast and accurate misaligned gradient aggression, please refer to [https://github.com/auto-Dog/Fed_MisAligned_OAC](https://github.com/auto-Dog/Fed_MisAligned_OAC)
